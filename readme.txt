== Description ==

* SpatialMatch&reg; FREE Lifestyle Search is a revolutionary lifestyle real estate search engine plugin for real estate professionals focusing on the broader lifestyle needs of a potential homeowner.

* SpatialMatch&reg; FREE Lifestyle Search enables the dream by allowing consumers to search for the particular area(s) that best match the hyper-local factors that impact the style and quality of life (i.e. the consumer &quot;lifestyle&quot;).

* Consumers can search for neighborhoods or communities based upon any combination of parameters relating to demographics, education, points of interest, neighborhoods, and more (i.e. looking for the micro communities in a particular area that are in close proximity to the right high school, favorite coffee shop, place of worship and grocery store(s) is critical to today's real estate consumer).

* SpatialMatch&reg; FREE Lifestyle Search plugin instantly improves your websites competitiveness.  It delivers a fun, interactive map-based user experience that displays all their selected lifestyle factors.

* Build and manage unlimited maps to be used in pages and posts.

* Also included are great sidebar, header and footer widgets for creating a quick search option, popup map buttons and more.  For instance, you regularly blog about the monthly sold homes in specific neighborhoods...now you can create a map, draw or select the area and turn on "recently sold" and you have a wonderful visual aid to drop into your posts.

* **Also available with integrated IDX listings.**
